# Kambui Parish Website
### Stack:
1. HTML
1. CSS
1. Bootstrap

I created this website mainly to put into practise the Bootstrap skills I had gained.

### My Take Aways:
> Link bootstrap css in the head tag through like this. Do this before the link to your own css file so that you can overwrite the BootStrap defaults at your own will

```html
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="../Bootsrap/Bootstrap 5/Bootstrap files/css/bootstrap.min.css">

```
>link bootstrap JavaScript close to the closing tag of the body tags like this

```html
<script src="../Bootsrap/Bootstrap 5/Bootstrap files/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
```
These provide access to the online Bootstrap files. If you wish to develop online you can also download Bootstrap and follow the documentation to link it to your HTML file

>### IMPORTANT: If you default to use the offline version of Bootstrap, remember to add the above lines of code to your HTML before hosting your site.
